# Drexel University Syllabi Library
### This is a ***community-compiled*** list of current and past syllabi at Drexel University in Philadelphia. The goal of this project is to allow student to get a more in-depth look into a course then would be provided by standard means.



## Tree Organization
#### The syllabi are organized by term/year => course => professor name => revisions (if applicable). If there is a single syllabi used across all classes/sections of a course, then the professor's name is left out and the files are places directly into the course folder.
